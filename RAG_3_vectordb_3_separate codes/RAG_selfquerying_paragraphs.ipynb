      "Answer: The study was conducted in two stages, with the first stage involving within-case analysis to allow unique patterns of each case to emerge, and the second stage involving cross-case analysis using analytic induction to search for common patterns and unique features. To ensure internal validity, three sources of evidence were used: direct observation, documentation, and interviews. The researchers spent several days at each site observing how each Electronic Medical Record (EMR) was used, analyzed system and project documentation, and conducted interviews, which were then corroborated, validated, and complemented with data from the other sources. The cross-case analysis was conducted using two tactics: selecting categories to identify patterns in each dimension of the framework, and comparing cases in pairs to identify subtle similarities and differences. The research sites were selected to maximize variation and allow comparison, with similarities and variations in three characteristics of the cases: hospital type, software package, and outcome.\n"
