      "        The objective of this paper is to contribute to a deeper understanding of system usage in organizations by examining its multilevel nature. Past research on system usage has suffered from a levels bias, with researchers studying system usage at single levels of analysis only (e.g., the individual, group, or organizational level). Although single-level research can be useful, we suggest that studying organizations one level at a time will ultimately lead to an unnatural, incomplete, and very disjointed view of how information systems are used in 1 Deborah Compeau was the accepting senior editor for this paper. Natalia Levina, Teresa Marcon, and Neil Ramiller served as reviewers. The associate editor chose to remain anonymous. practice. To redress this situation, we draw on recent advances in multilevel theory to present system usage as a multilevel construct and provide an illustration for what it takes for researchers to study it as such. The multilevel perspective advanced in this article offers rich opportunities for theoretical and empirical insights and suggests a new foundation for in-depth research on the nature of system usage, its emergence and change, and its antecedents and consequences. \n",

      "        A basic activity in any research field is to reach a deep understanding of the phenomena it studies. For example, information systems researchers have recently scrutinized phenomena such as users (Lamb and Kling 2003) , user competence (Marcolin et al. 2001) , and the IT artifact (Orlikowski and Iacono 2001) . We examine another core phenomenon: system usage. Although system usage has been studied for many years (Barkin and Dickson 1977) , researchers stress how little we know about it (DeLone and McLean 2003) . While many aspects of system usage could be studied, we focus on just one, its multilevel nature. \n",
