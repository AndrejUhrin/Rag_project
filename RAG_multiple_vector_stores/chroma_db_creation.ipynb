In this paper, we examine how the social structures (i.e., genre rules) that emerge around different communication tools (the nurture of communication) can be as important in influencing performance. During habitual use situations, team members enact genre rules associated with communication tools without conscious thought via automaticity. These genre rules influence how teams interact and ultimately how well they perform. We conducted an experimental study to examine the impact of different genre rules that have developed for two communication tools: instant messenger and discussion forum. Our results show that in habitual use situations, these tools triggered different genre rules with different behaviors, which in turn resulted in significantly different decision quality. We used heightened time pressure as a discrepant event to interrupt the automatic enactment of habitual genre rules and found that users adopted similar behaviors for both tools, which resulted in no significant differences in decision quality. These findings suggest that the automatic enactment of genre rules for a communication tool may have as powerful an effect on behavior and performance as the actual features of the tool itself. We believe that our results, taken together with past research showing the effects of social structures on communication, call for the expansion of task-technology fit theories to include the role of social structures in explaining the use of and performance from communication tools. keywords: Collaboration, virtual teams, genre rules, structuration theory, IM, discussion board, time pressure citation_count: 4\n",

Drawing on coping theory, we posit that users choose different adaptation strategies based on a combination of primary appraisal (i.e., a user's assessment of the expected consequences of an IT event) and secondary appraisal (i.e., a user's assessment of his/her control over the situation). On that basis, we identify four adaptation strategies (benefits maximizing, benefits satisficing, disturbance handling, and self-preservation) which are hypothesized to result in three different individual-level outcomes: restoring emotional stability, minimizing the perceived threats of the technology, and improving user effectiveness and efficiency. A study of the adaptation behaviors of six account managers in two large North American banks provides preliminary support for our model. By explaining adaptation patterns based on users' initial appraisal and subsequent responses to an IT event, our model offers predictive power while retaining an agency view of user adaptation. Also, by focusing on user cognitive and behavioral adaptation responses related to the technology, the work system, and the self, our model accounts for a wide range of user behaviors such as technology appropriation, avoidance, and resistance. keywords: Coping theory, user adaptation, IT appropriation, individual performance citation_count: 299\n",
      "article_id: 1658 authors: Burton-Jones, Andrew; Gallivan, Michael J. year: 2007 title: Toward a Deeper Understanding of System Usage in Organizations: A Multilevel Perspective journal: Management Information Systems Quarterly abstract: The objective of this paper is to contribute to a deeper understanding of system usage in organizations by examining its multilevel nature. Past research on system usage has suffered from a levels bias, with researchers studying system usage at single levels of analysis only (e.g., the individual, group, or organizational level). Although single-level research can be useful, we suggest that studying organizations one level at a time will ultimately lead to an unnatural, incomplete, and very disjointed view of how information systems are used in practice. To redress this situation, we draw on recent advances in multilevel theory to present system usage as a multilevel construct and provide an illustration for what it takes for researchers to study it as such. The multilevel perspective advanced in this article offers rich opportunities for theoretical and empirical insights and suggests a new foundation for in-depth research on the nature of system usage, its emergence and change, and its antecedents and consequences. keywords: System usage, multilevel, construct, configura- tion, IT impact, longitudinal citation_count: 0\n",
      "article_id: 6541 authors: Kim, Sung S. year: 2009 title: The Integrative Framework of Technology Use: An Extension and Test journal: Management Information Systems Quarterly abstract: The integrative framework of technology use (IFTU) posits that to fully explain post-adoption phenomena, four mechanisms--namely, reason-oriented action, sequential updating feedback, and habit--should be taken into account simultaneously in a unified model. Although IFTU sheds light on the four mechanisms underlying technology use, it lacks a coherent theoretical explanation for the underlying force that leads to the four mechanisms. To offer a more generalized and richer description of the four mechanisms, this study extends IFTU by drawing on the process model of memory in cognitive psychology. In addition, based on the extended IFTU paradigm, a three-wave panel model is developed that incorporates not only proximal effects but also distal effects of the four mechanisms on post-adoption phenomena. Three different sets of data (n=195, 160, and 342, respectively) are used to test the proposed model. The results of data analysis show that, as expected, the four mechanisms have proximal effects on subsequent evaluations and behavior. Furthermore, consistent with the memory perspective, the sequential updating and habit mechanisms are found to have distal effects on post-adoption phenomena even after controlling for their proximal effects. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that the memory perspective offers not only a seamless explanation of the four mechanisms underlying technology use but also yields deeper insights that can be validated only through a three-or-more-wave panel study. This research contributes to the literature by demonstrating that the extended IFTU paradigm has the potential to serve as a coherent theoretical framework on post-adoption phenomena in which prior experiences are internalized into memories, which in turn regulate later experiences. keywords: Longitudinal study, panel model, technology use, continued use, theory of planned behavior (TPB), process model of memory, path analysis citation_count: 67\n",
      "article_id: 7061 authors: Lapointe, Liette; Rivard, Suzanne year: 2005 title: A Multilevel Model of Resistance to Information Technology Implementation journal: Management Information Systems Quarterly abstract: To better explain resistance to information technology implementation, we used a multilevel, longitudinal approach. We first assessed extant models of resistance to IT. Using semantic analysis, we identified five basic components of resistance: behaviors, object, subject, threats, and initial conditions. We further examined extant models to (1) carry out a preliminary specification of the nature of the relationships between these components and (2) refine our understanding of the multilevel nature of the phenomenon. Using analytic induction, we examined data from three case studies of clinical information systems implementations in hospital settings, focusing on physicians' resistance behaviors. The resulting mixed-determinants model suggests that group resistance behaviors vary during implementation. When a system is introduced, users in a group will first assess it in terms of the interplay between its features and individual and/or organizational-level initial conditions. They then make projections about the consequences of its use. If expected consequences are threatening, resistance behaviors will result. During implementation, should some trigger occur to either modify or activate an initial condition involving the balance of power between the group and other user groups, it will also modify the object of resistance, from system to system significance. If the relevant initial conditions pertain to the power of the resisting group vis-à-vis the system advocates, the object of resistance will also be modified, from system significance to system advocates. Resistance behaviors will follow if threats are perceived from the interaction between the object of resistance and initial conditions. We also found that the bottom-up process by which group resistance behaviors emerge from individual behaviors is not the same in early versus late implementation. In early implementation, the emergence process is one of compilation, described as a combination of independent, individual behaviors. In later stages of implementation, if group level initial conditions have become active, the emergence process is one of composition, described as the convergence of individual behaviors. keywords: User resistance, information techno- logy implementation, information system imple- mentation, longitudinal perspective, multilevel ap- proach, resistance behaviors, semantic analysis, case study citation_count: 296\n"

Although IFTU sheds light on the four mechanisms underlying technology use, it lacks a coherent theoretical explanation for the underlying force that leads to the four mechanisms. To offer a more generalized and richer description of the four mechanisms, this study extends IFTU by drawing on the process model of memory in cognitive psychology. In addition, based on the extended IFTU paradigm, a three-wave panel model is developed that incorporates not only proximal effects but also distal effects of the four mechanisms on post-adoption phenomena. Three different sets of data (n=195, 160, and 342, respectively) are used to test the proposed model. The results of data analysis show that, as expected, the four mechanisms have proximal effects on subsequent evaluations and behavior. Furthermore, consistent with the memory perspective, the sequential updating and habit mechanisms are found to have distal effects on post-adoption phenomena even after controlling for their proximal effects. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that the memory perspective offers not only a seamless explanation of the four mechanisms underlying technology use but also yields deeper insights that can be validated only through a three-or-more-wave panel study. This research contributes to the literature by demonstrating that the extended IFTU paradigm has the potential to serve as a coherent theoretical framework on post-adoption phenomena in which prior experiences are internalized into memories, which in turn regulate later experiences. keywords: Longitudinal study, panel model, technology use, continued use, theory of planned behavior (TPB), process model of memory, path analysis citation_count: 67\n",

We first assessed extant models of resistance to IT. Using semantic analysis, we identified five basic components of resistance: behaviors, object, subject, threats, and initial conditions. We further examined extant models to (1) carry out a preliminary specification of the nature of the relationships between these components and (2) refine our understanding of the multilevel nature of the phenomenon. Using analytic induction, we examined data from three case studies of clinical information systems implementations in hospital settings, focusing on physicians' resistance behaviors. The resulting mixed-determinants model suggests that group resistance behaviors vary during implementation. When a system is introduced, users in a group will first assess it in terms of the interplay between its features and individual and/or organizational-level initial conditions. They then make projections about the consequences of its use. If expected consequences are threatening, resistance behaviors will result. During implementation, should some trigger occur to either modify or activate an initial condition involving the balance of power between the group and other user groups, it will also modify the object of resistance, from system to system significance. If the relevant initial conditions pertain to the power of the resisting group vis-à-vis the system advocates, the object of resistance will also be modified, from system significance to system advocates. Resistance behaviors will follow if threats are perceived from the interaction between the object of resistance and initial conditions. We also found that the bottom-up process by which group resistance behaviors emerge from individual behaviors is not the same in early versus late implementation. In early implementation, the emergence process is one of compilation, described as a combination of independent, individual behaviors. In later stages of implementation, if group level initial conditions have become active, the emergence process is one of composition, described as the convergence of individual behaviors. keywords: User resistance, information techno- logy implementation, information system imple- mentation, longitudinal perspective, multilevel ap- proach, resistance behaviors, semantic analysis, case study citation_count: 296\n",

In this essay, we explore the theoretical underpinnings of IS research on continuing IT use. Although the IS literature on continuing IT use emphasizes the role of habitual behavior that does not require conscious behavioral intention, it does so in a way that largely remains faithful to the theoretical tradition of planned behavior and reasoned action. However, a close reading of reference literatures on automatic behavior (behavior that is not consciously controlled) and the influences of emotion on behavior suggests that planned behavior and reasoned action may not provide the best theoretical foundation for the study of continuing IT use. As a result, we call for empirical research that directly compares and contrasts the consensus theory of continuing IT use with rival theories that place much greater emphasis on unplanned and unreasoned action keywords: Continuing IT use, IT continuance, post-adoptive IT usage, automatic behavior, environmental triggers, habit, emotion, intention, cognition, reasoned action, planned behavior citation_count: 75\", metadata={'abstract': \"One of the most welcome recent developments in Information Systems scholarship has been the growing interest in individuals' continuing use of information technology well after initial adoption, known in the literature as IT usage, IT continuance, and post-adoptive IT usage.

      "Page Content: Much prior research on virtual teams has examined the impact of the features and capabilities of different communication tools (the nature of communication) on team performance. In this paper, we examine how the social structures (i.e., genre rules) that emerge around different communication tools (the nurture of communication) can be as important in influencing performance. During habitual use situations, team members enact genre rules associated with communication tools without conscious thought via automaticity. These genre rules influence how teams interact and ultimately how well they perform. We conducted an experimental study to examine the impact of different genre rules that have developed for two communication tools: instant messenger and discussion forum. Our results show that in habitual use situations, these tools triggered different genre rules with different behaviors, which in turn resulted in significantly different decision quality. We used heightened time pressure as a discrepant event to interrupt the automatic enactment of habitual genre rules and found that users adopted similar behaviors for both tools, which resulted in no significant differences in decision quality. These findings suggest that the automatic enactment of genre rules for a communication tool may have as powerful an effect on behavior and performance as the actual features of the tool itself. We believe that our results, taken together with past research showing the effects of social structures on communication, call for the expansion of task-technology fit theories to include the role of social structures in explaining the use of and performance from communication tools. \n",

      "Page Content: Prior research has argued-and demonstrated empiricallythat the nature of a communication technology (i.e., its innate features and capabilities) influences both how the tool is used, and the type of performance that ensues from its use (Dennis and Wixom 2001-02;Fjermested and Hiltz 1998-99). That is, the task-technology fit of a communication technology not only matters, but has a substantial influence on the processes and outcomes of communication (Zigurs and Buckland 1998) . Past research has also shown that teams can use the innate features of technologies in different ways that are faithful or unfaithful to their intent (DeSanctis and Pool 1994) and that the way a tool is used can significantly affect behavior and performance (Dennis et al. 2001) . \n",

      "Page Content: In this paper, we argue that nurture has an equally important impact on the processes and outcomes of communication. By nurture, we mean the social structures for using a communication technology that are habitually enacted, usually without a conscious decision (i.e., the genre rules). Genre rules are the social structures that guide the form and substance of communication (Orlikowski and Yates 1994; Yates and Orlikowski 1992) . Genre rules develop over time from repeated use of a communication tool and are typically based on the commonly occurring habitual patterns of use that emerge (Erickson 1999) . Genre rules are influenced by the capabilities of the tool itself and usually emerge from repeated use (Karjalainen and Salminen 2000) , although they can develop through formal guidance (Thomas and Bostrom 2010b; Yates et al. 1999) . Genre rules are usually enacted without a conscious decision (they are akin to a habit), unlike the deliberate appropriation processes that occur during the adoption of new technologies (DeSanctis and Poole 1994) . \n",

      "Page Content: Genre rules are like many other social structures in that they both enable and constrain future behavior, and evolve over time (Giddens 1984) . The genre rules that have grown from communication tool use exhibit a powerful impact on the processes of communication, above and beyond the innate nature of the communication tool itself. Past research has shown that genre rules influence behavior (e.g., Köhler et al. 2012; Yates and Orlikowski 2002; Yates et al. 1999 ), but we are unaware of any research that has shown that genre rules influence the outcomes of team work. Thus, one key question that this paper addresses is: Does the use of different genre rules lead to different outcomes? Technology use has traditionally been considered as being based on rational, intentional choices about behavior (Ortiz de Guinea and Markus 2009); however, in recent years, researchers have come to realize that much of human behavior, especially habitual behavior (such as use of a familiar technology), is performed without conscious thought (Jasperson et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2005; Limayem et al. 2007; Ortiz de Guinea and Markus 2009 ). Instead, when users encounter a familiar situation, they enact the social structures they have used in the past, automatically and without thought (Bargh and Morsella 2009; Kim et al. 2005; Ortiz de Guinea and Markus 2009) . \n",
