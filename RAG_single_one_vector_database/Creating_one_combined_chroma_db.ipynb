      "Page Content: Much prior research on virtual teams has examined the impact of the features and capabilities of different communication tools (the nature of communication) on team performance. In this paper, we examine how the social structures (i.e., genre rules) that emerge around different communication tools (the nurture of communication) can be as important in influencing performance. During habitual use situations, team members enact genre rules associated with communication tools without conscious thought via automaticity. These genre rules influence how teams interact and ultimately how well they perform. We conducted an experimental study to examine the impact of different genre rules that have developed for two communication tools: instant messenger and discussion forum. Our results show that in habitual use situations, these tools triggered different genre rules with different behaviors, which in turn resulted in significantly different decision quality. We used heightened time pressure as a discrepant event to interrupt the automatic enactment of habitual genre rules and found that users adopted similar behaviors for both tools, which resulted in no significant differences in decision quality. These findings suggest that the automatic enactment of genre rules for a communication tool may have as powerful an effect on behavior and performance as the actual features of the tool itself. We believe that our results, taken together with past research showing the effects of social structures on communication, call for the expansion of task-technology fit theories to include the role of social structures in explaining the use of and performance from communication tools. \n",

      "Page Content: Prior research has argued-and demonstrated empiricallythat the nature of a communication technology (i.e., its innate features and capabilities) influences both how the tool is used, and the type of performance that ensues from its use (Dennis and Wixom 2001-02;Fjermested and Hiltz 1998-99). That is, the task-technology fit of a communication technology not only matters, but has a substantial influence on the processes and outcomes of communication (Zigurs and Buckland 1998) . Past research has also shown that teams can use the innate features of technologies in different ways that are faithful or unfaithful to their intent (DeSanctis and Pool 1994) and that the way a tool is used can significantly affect behavior and performance (Dennis et al. 2001) . \n",

      "Page Content: In this paper, we argue that nurture has an equally important impact on the processes and outcomes of communication. By nurture, we mean the social structures for using a communication technology that are habitually enacted, usually without a conscious decision (i.e., the genre rules). Genre rules are the social structures that guide the form and substance of communication (Orlikowski and Yates 1994; Yates and Orlikowski 1992) . Genre rules develop over time from repeated use of a communication tool and are typically based on the commonly occurring habitual patterns of use that emerge (Erickson 1999) . Genre rules are influenced by the capabilities of the tool itself and usually emerge from repeated use (Karjalainen and Salminen 2000) , although they can develop through formal guidance (Thomas and Bostrom 2010b; Yates et al. 1999) . Genre rules are usually enacted without a conscious decision (they are akin to a habit), unlike the deliberate appropriation processes that occur during the adoption of new technologies (DeSanctis and Poole 1994) . \n",

      "Page Content: Genre rules are like many other social structures in that they both enable and constrain future behavior, and evolve over time (Giddens 1984) . The genre rules that have grown from communication tool use exhibit a powerful impact on the processes of communication, above and beyond the innate nature of the communication tool itself. Past research has shown that genre rules influence behavior (e.g., Köhler et al. 2012; Yates and Orlikowski 2002; Yates et al. 1999 ), but we are unaware of any research that has shown that genre rules influence the outcomes of team work. Thus, one key question that this paper addresses is: Does the use of different genre rules lead to different outcomes? Technology use has traditionally been considered as being based on rational, intentional choices about behavior (Ortiz de Guinea and Markus 2009); however, in recent years, researchers have come to realize that much of human behavior, especially habitual behavior (such as use of a familiar technology), is performed without conscious thought (Jasperson et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2005; Limayem et al. 2007; Ortiz de Guinea and Markus 2009 ). Instead, when users encounter a familiar situation, they enact the social structures they have used in the past, automatically and without thought (Bargh and Morsella 2009; Kim et al. 2005; Ortiz de Guinea and Markus 2009) . \n",
